# Hangman-game(Guess The Animal).ðŸ«¡

This is my first git repository which implements an interactive browser-based Hangman game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The playerâ€™s goal is to guess the name of a randomly selected animal by choosing letters from the alphabet. Each wrong guess gradually reveals parts of the hangman figure. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses all letters in the word or makes 10 incorrect guesses.


Features Implemented:
    1.Dynamic Alphabet Buttons.
    2.A random animal name is selected from a pre-defined array of over 200 animal names.
    3.Spaces in multi-word animal names are automatically handled. Each letter has a hidden <span> that reveals on            correct guesses.
    4.Hangman Animation.
    5.Feedback on Guesses:
         i)	Correct letters turn the button green.
         ii) Wrong letters turn the button red.
    6.Game Messages.
    7.Responsive Design:
