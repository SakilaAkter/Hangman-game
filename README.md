🐾 Hangman Game – Guess The Animal
This is an interactive browser-based Hangman game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The player’s goal is to guess the name of a randomly selected animal by choosing letters from the alphabet.
Each wrong guess reveals a part of the hangman figure. The game ends when:
•	✅ The player guesses all the letters correctly, or
•	❌ The player makes 10 incorrect guesses.
